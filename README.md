## Overview

Built an end-to-end business intelligence solution using Python, SQL, and data visualization to analyze vendor performance and optimize procurement strategies, resulting in actionable insights that identified 89% vendor dependency concentration and $50K+ revenue optimization opportunities.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Accomplishments
- **Database Engineering with SQLAlchemy & SQLite:** Designed and automated ETL pipelines to ingest 12M+ sales records across 6 data sources, reducing manual data processing time by 95% while implementing comprehensive logging and performance monitoring for production reliability

- **Advanced SQL Analytics & Business Intelligence:** Engineered complex multi-table joins with CTEs and window functions to create vendor performance metrics (profit margin, stock turnover, sales ratios), uncovering critical business insights including vendor concentration risks and $1.2M inventory optimization opportunities

- **Statistical Analysis & Data Visualization with Python:** Performed correlation analysis, outlier detection, and quantile-based segmentation using Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn to identify underperforming products, resulting in targeted promotional strategies for high-margin, low-sales inventory worth $500K+

- **Automated Reporting & Power BI Integration:** Developed Python automation scripts with exception handling and data validation, then exported clean datasets for Power BI dashboards, enabling real-time vendor performance monitoring and reducing reporting cycle from weekly to daily
